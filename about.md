5+ years of experience as a data scientist with strong foundations in Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis and Computer Science. My interest lies in classical and deep learning techniques for Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

At AT&T, I have been involved in leading projects technically as well as managing client interactions.
I have diverse experience in multiple stages of a data science project implementation lifecycle, including:
— processing large datasets on distributed systems, 
— generating features at scale
— implementing machine learning and statistical models and,
— presenting insights, interpretations and visualizations to the clients
I have also technically mentored three data science interns on NLP projects and authored a pending patent on Topic Modeling.
